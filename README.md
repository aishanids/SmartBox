Traditional Farming
The greatest culmination of humanity's evolution is our ability to have produced food at a pace that has kept up with our booming population. While this is a monumental achievement, there are many issues that must be resolved. Current agricultural and farming practices are impractical for future generations. Global agriculture is quickly reaching the limits of land use, degrading and eroding soils, depleting and polluting ground and surface water, driving biodiversity loss, and causing substantial greenhouse gas emissions.

Approximately one-third of the world’s soil resources are moderately to highly degraded. Estimates of annual crop loss due to erosion predict that by 2050 we will have removed the equivalent of 150 million hectares from crop production, approximately 10% of our global farmland. The erosion of soil occurs naturally but current farming practices exacerbate the fertility and climate change regulation capacity.

Another challenge that traditional farming faces is reversing ground and surface water depletion and pollution. Agriculture accounts for  70% of water withdrawal globally and is the leading cause of water pollution through harmful discharge including agrochemicals, nutrients, organic matter, drug residues, sediments, microplastics, pathogens, and induces salinization and alkalinization through saline drainage. The depletion leads to increased pumping costs which may eventually lead to water becoming economically unreachable and the pollution will cause significant damage to human health.

In addition, farming is posing a major threat to the planet’s biodiversity. Biodiversity is critical to the productivity and stability of domesticated and harvested plants and animals. Farming techniques such as  tilling, excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, monocropping, land cover conversion, capture fisheries, and other hunting activities, have tremendous negative impacts on biodiversity. Extensive damage will ultimately lead to considerable food insecurity.

Furthermore, the global food system contributes up to 35% of global greenhouse gas emissions, of which 25% is due to agriculture, forestry, and other land uses. The remaining 10% is due to food system activities after primary production, including distribution, processing, cooking, storing, and refrigeration. Significant contributors include deforestation, fertilizer manufacturing and use, mechanization, fishing, soil and manure management, and waste disposal. The forest is Earth’s largest natural land-based carbon sequestration system. As the human population explodes, the adverse effects of the ever-increasing demand for food will have disastrous ramifications for the environment and ultimately all future generations of humanity.

What are Aquaponic and Hydroponic Systems ?
Aquaponics is an agricultural form that utilizes fish raised in tanks in order to essentially provide nutrients and needed substances to plants. This soil-less plant culture, which utilizes aquaculture that recirculates water, relies heavily on fish waste which is nutrient rich, acts as a natural fertilizer, and purifies the water. This is used to sustainably raise fresh fish, generate profit, adaptable to different climates in addition to being pesticides and herbicides free. Aquaponics is also beneficial due to the fact that no growth hormones and antibiotics for the fish are used which could be detrimental to the health of the fish. On the other hand, hydroponics does not rely on fish for nutrients or use of soil and uses fresh water and a root support system to get the plants the needed materials. The difference that hydroponics includes in that  “plant food” must be included in water for the development of crops. 
 
Hydroponic Systems
Aquaponics (AP) combines two technologies: recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS) and hydroponics (plant production in water, without soil) in a closed-loop system. [2] There are four main hydroponic systems used; ebb and flow, drip, deep water culture, and Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system. 

Deep water culture systems is an active hydroponics system. The deep water culture system requires that roots be constantly submerged in oxygenated nutrient rich solution. These systems require air pumps, reservoirs, air stones, and plant containers. The volume of water does not change rapidly, allowing the chemistry of the solution to stay consistent. Electrical outages or pump malfunctions are less of a concern because the plants will take longer to dry out. 

In a drip system, nutrient solution is continuously flowing across the ends of plant roots. A pump and timer are needed to deliver the slow feed of solution needed. This system is high output and low maintenance. [3] Despite this, drip lines are prone to clogging because of the decreased pressure in water flow. 
The ebb and flow system temporarily floods the grow tray with nutrient solution at carefully timed intervals. A pump and timer are required to flood and drain the tray every few hours. Most plants benefit from cycles of dryness to wetness. However, the success of this system is very dependent on the structure used. The structure must support the weight of a flooded growth tray as well as plants and channels for drainage. 

Nutrient film technique uses gulleys to run nutrient solution across the roots of plants, only watering the tips. Pumps and multilevel set ups are used so gravity can guide the solution through established channels. Because this system holds less water, it is easier to stack, clean, and customize. [1]

Types of Irrigation Systems

The implementation of an aquaponic system requires the use of one or more irrigation systems in order to ensure the circulation of water as well as maintain the sterile environment for the fish as well as the pH levels of the tank. The most commonly used systems include Rainwater to Drip Irrigation, Fishery Irrigation Options, Leveled Drip Irrigation, and Timed Irrigation Systems. As multiple aquaponic system owners were observed, they used collected rainwater for their fish tanks to maintain the a neutral pH level. Its use in drip irrigation, a method that allows water to slowly drip towards the plant roots from below the surface, keeps the pH range from 6.8 – 7.2 which is beneficial for the fish.  The utilization of tap water is generally not advised as it may contain chlorine and chloramine to disinfect the water. The fishery irrigation systems involves fish and their waste to provide nutrients to the plants. Inorder to combat the algae build up, pumps can be installed to circulate water and avoid a harmful tank condition. Needing the precise distribution of water is essential due to each plant having specific needs. Leveled Drip irrigation aids in this issue by having timers and a rotating system where plants can receive the correct amount of water when needed.The use of multiple levels can save space and this method ensures that all plants obtain the needed nutrients and materials. This goes hand in hand with the timed irrigation system as human labor for maintaining watering time can become an inconvenience. Having a timer that regularly provides the necessities for these plants can result in faster growth with a healthier yield of crops. The incorporation of different types of irrigation systems for methods of distribution of water could improve efficiency in maintaining the system. 
 
Different Types of Plumbing
Specifically in the scope of an aquaponics system, the most feasible plumbing systems must be considered; those being the One-loop System and the Split Flow System. Once the type of system is chosen the design process can shift towards other features such as the use of either gravity or a pump to direct the water flow and the need for a pressurized flow or a weak flow which then all will help determine the best choice for the layout of the garden. The choice of plumbing system will be crucial to the design of an efficient aquaponics system. 

In a One-loop system, a single flow of water is continuously directed through the fish and the filtration and the plants. The advantage of this system is the simple set up that is formed from this circuit. A disadvantage of this system is that there are often many compromises that have to be made when it comes to water quality. Namely, it is difficult to manage the pH and Nitrogen levels in the water, creating the need for biofilters to help stabilize the water. This plumbing system is more labor intensive than would be desired and the effects of an error could be detrimental to the health of the fish and the plants. 

The Split-flow System is made up of a pressurized water line which diverts or “splits” the water into two separate lines, one to the plants and one to the fish. To complete the circuit the water is then collected into one body before it reenters filtration. As a result, there is less unwanted contamination between the two water supplies and the system is easier to maintain. Overall, the split flow system is less of a risk when it comes to maintaining the health of the plants and fish working in the system. 

Moving to An Automated System
In an aquaponics system, there are many components that must be accounted for on a regular basis such as the pH of the water throughout the system and the flow rate of the water as it is distributed to the plants. If any of these parameters were to be out of line with the requirements of the system the health of the plants and structure of the garden could be compromised. An aquaponics system lacking in automation will require a higher amount of labor from the agriculturalist. The agriculturalist would manually inspect the system and make adjustments which could otherwise be avoided. In shifting to an automated system, some pieces of technology to be considered are water flow sensors, pH sensors, micro controllers, and mobile applications. 
Dependent on the structure of the aquaponics system, the amount of water that each section of plants receives is crucial to the health of the plants and the continuity of the system. A water flow sensor makes it easy to know the rate at which water is being output by a valve that transfers water to the plants. If there is an irregularity to the desired flow rate the agriculturalist can then simply adjust the valve without having to do any guess work to reach the proper state. 
The goal pH level of an aquaponics system is typically 6.8-7.0 (neutral). This creates a healthy environment for both the fish and the plants. If the pH level of the system were to change without the knowledge of an attendee then the fish could be harmed and the plants would be lacking in their source of nutrients. With a pH sensor, the agriculturalist can be immediately notified of the rise or drop in pH level of the water and take the proper steps to fix the problem. 
A microcontroller is an Integrated Circuit that can be used in correspondence with a sensor; while the sensor monitors information, such as flow rate from a water flow sensor or pH level from a pH sensor, a microcontroller would allow for the processing, recording and analyzing of information. A popular and attainable example of a microcontroller is the Arduino Uno. 
In order to create a fully automated system, a mobile application could be developed for the agriculturalist of the aquaponics system. The app could be connected to any sensors that are present in the system, and all the data that is gathered by the microcontrollers could be available to the agriculturalist within the app. In addition, if a sensor within the system detected an irregularity the agriculturalist would be notified of the problem and of its location, allowing them to go fix the system as quickly as possible. A mobile application could be the key to creating an unmanned, easy to manage aquaponics system, that is suitably managed by the common household. 

Importance
Global environmental, social and economic challenges drive the need for solutions for food production. Aquaponics presents solutions to soil degradation, scarcity of resources, shortage of drinking water, and loss of biodiversity.[2] Adopting a different production model where hydroponic units produce agricultural products also solves the unpredictability of weather driven and externally influenced agricultural production.[5] For aquaponics to become a significant part of global food production and deliver its environmental benefits, it must return a profit. Perfecting the design and operation of aquaponic production systems is the main focus of aquaponic research to date. [4 ] Automation needs to be refined to allow more precision and labor efficient operations. The steps to take are selection, development and implementation of relevant sensors, data analysis and modeling, and development in automation. [2] System efficiency reduces production costs, improves yield, and increases profit.

Goals and Visions

The implementation of our version of the brain box should increase the use of aquaponics in regular homes by making set up more efficient and to yield the most crops. In addition, making this box “smart” and having valves controlled by an app could make tending to the water from becoming dirty much easier due to prior detection of possible algae/toxic build up. The overall vision of this product is to contribute to the efforts that aim to lessen the severity of climate change. Developing a personal backyard garden with the aid of the brain box and an efficient aquaponics system not only curbs food waste to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but also significantly reduces the need for resources such as extra water since this system is essentially a “cycle” and reuses the water after plants obtain their nutrients from fish waste and a filtration process is implemented to ensure the sterility of the water at all times. With food waste alone generating gas emissions worth 37 million cars, the notion of being able to grow the amount of food a family needs would combat the excess food needing to be discarded.

Potential Solutions

Hydroponics vs. Aquaponics

While looking at aquaculture and its benefits of growing plants rather than the traditional farming methods, there are different water based systems that have been used to cultivate crops, two of which include Hydroponics and Aquaponics. Aquaponics essentially uses fish and their waste to provide nutrients for plant growth whereas hydroponics incorporates formulated solutions or nitrates. Aquaponics usually has a higher growth rate of plants compared to traditional methods of farming and can account for season change, meaning plants can be grown at any time of year and in different environmental conditions. This method also uses less water than the conventional farming methods due to the recycling of water in the system, which makes it adaptable to grow plants in places that lack water. Hydroponics, on the other hand, requires the constant change of water supply in order to ensure the health of the tanks to avoid buildup of harmful bacteria or substances.  The nutrient solutions needed for this system are also high in cost. In aquaponics, The energy costs related to the production, processing, and distribution of fish feed are unknown, but expected to be significant.[7] Having a sterile environment for Hydroponics is key for plant growth and can become tough if there is a lack of manual labor, however, Aquaponics does not have this problem and is disease and pest free due to the recycling and regulation of water.

Electric Valves, Pumps, and Filtration
With the utilization of electric valves, the amount of water used in the aquaponics system could be recorded and analyzed. Alongside the recorded health of the vegetation, agriculturists could find the optimal amount of water to use in their gardens, thus cutting back on the overall consumption of water and producing less waste. Water flow and pressure sensors that are incorporated into the brain box would aid in controlling and calculating the distribution of water to limit use of extra resources that are not needed. A commonly faced problem with aquaponic cultivation is also the blockage of pumps and how they are clogged due to minerals & nutrients. Pressurized flow is used to combat this issue, as the increase in water force would push the unnecessary materials out of the pumps to clear the path for water travel. To ensure that the water within the Brain Box stays clean and free of debris, a fountain will be added in the box to give the water a current. This acts as a filtration system that would allow the efficient removal of unwanted substances and objects. Once the water has a current, it can continuously flow past filter gates that catch leaves and other larger debris. The debris will then be moved into an exterior basket that traps the debris, while allowing the water to continue to flow with the current. 

Mobile Application
As a supplement to the Smart Brain Box, an app would be created to  monitor levels of water, plants, pH level. There would be a device w/ sensors that measures different features, ex. pH, temp, oxygen levels, water levels and would report back to the app, which would then store the data in a way that is efficient for the cultivist. This is a quick snapshot of what the interface would look like when they would open up the app to check in on the watering schedule or needs to modify valve options. As shown, there is a login page that would lead to more customizable options to manage valves and timings.

Microcontroller
A microcontroller connected to different sensors that monitor pH, temperature, oxygen levels, water levels, and water pressure. This would send data to an app. This would automate real-time data collection and analysis, i.e., continually monitor and analyze the conditions of fish and plants at different sites, take automated corrective measures to balance the deviation based on ideal data from experts to increase revenue and reduce risks of false data and reduce manual human interactions. . The operator connected to the operations cloud could control the various systems of the aquaponics such as heaters, lights and fish feeders or change parameters of filtering equipment according to his system intervention rights, remotely. All the collected data can be analyzed to get an insight into the growth as well as the energy/systems utilizations and can be used to make the models for Predictive analytics robust [6].
